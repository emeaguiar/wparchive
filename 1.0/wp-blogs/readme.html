Wordpress and Smarty Templates
==============================

What is it?
===========
Smarty Templates make it much easier to change the look and feel of 
your weblog.
Using them we can seperate out the PHP code that runs the site and 
the actual html and content very easily. They're good for 
us, the developers and good for you, the weblog owner!
This directory is here because in the future it'll be possible to
run several weblogs from one WordPress installation. The different
blogs will live in sub-directories of this one.

How?
====
Smarty support in Wordpress is still very much in the testing phase 
but it's usable today if you follow the instructions below:

1. Go to http://smarty.php.net/ and download the latest stable 
   release of Smarty. It's version 2.5.0 at the time of writing.
2. Install Smarty in the WP directory. (That usually means copying
   Smarty_Compiler.class.php, Smarty.class.php and Config_File.class.php)
3. Create a folder here called "main". In that folder create two
   more folders: "templates" and "templates_c".
4. The folder "templates_c" should be writable by the web server.
   In a UNIX environment, the easiest way to do that is with
   "chmod 777 templates_c", or changing the owner of it to the 
   same user that runs the web server. In a Windows environment
   fat32 you probably don't need to do anything, but in NTFS
   there may be some messing around to do.
5. The folder "wp-sitetemplates" in the main WP folder holds
   example template(s). Currently, there's only one, so copy 
   wp-sitetemplates/main/templates/*html into wp-blogs/main/templates/

In Unix:
(download and install Smarty.. DIY!)
  mkdir 
  mkdir main
  mkdir main/templates
  mkdir main/templates_c
  chmod 777 main/templates_c
  cp ../wp-sitetemplates/main/templates/*.html main/templates/

Open up your browser at the place where WP is installed, and launch
index-smarty.php! 
If your installation isn't a live one, then it's probably worth
overwriting index.php with index-smarty.php, making backups if necessary.
