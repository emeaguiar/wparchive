WordPress Plugins
=================

***WARNING***
This is a Work In Progress and shouldn't be relied upon for anything!

By using Smarty Templates we get to take advantage of the features
of that templating system. One of those is plugin support.

How?
====
Several different types of plugins can be written for Smarty. They're
all written in PHP and available to the template author when placed
in this directory.
Follow the simple instructions in the Smarty documentation[0] and
place your plugin in this directory. If you've created a "HelloWorld"
script then call it via {HelloWorld} in your site template! Plugins
will be distributed with WP eventually, and many b2++ plugins should 
work right now.
