Site Themes
===========

This directory will hold themes that WP blogs can use. Eventually there'll
be a nice "theme switcher" from inside the backend, but at present you
have to copy the files in these sub directories manually into 
wp-blogs/main/templates/

There's only one theme here at present, and that's the theme from the 
default installation of WP.
